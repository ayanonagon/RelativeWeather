Relative Weather
===============

A minimalist weather app that tells you how much hotter or colder it is today compared to yesterday. Find it on the App Store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/relative-weather/id607820526).

Currently in the middle of rewriting it in Swift (and open-sourcing it while Iâ€™m at it). :v:

TODO (very roughly)
----
- ~~Basic modeling & networking layer~~
- Imperial unit support
- Entire UI
