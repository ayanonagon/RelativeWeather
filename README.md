RelativeWeather
===============

Currently in the middle of rewriting [Relative Weather](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/relative-weather/id607820526) in Swift (and open-sourcing it while Iâ€™m at it).

TODO (very roughly)
----
- ~~Basic modeling & networking layer~~
- Imperial unit support
- Entire UI
